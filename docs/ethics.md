# Ethics and Responsible Use Guidelines

## Introduction

This document outlines ethical considerations and responsible use guidelines for the cattle movement risk early warning model. Given the sensitive context of conflict in South Sudan and the potential for misuse of predictive models, careful attention to ethics is paramount.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Do No Harm (Primum Non Nocere)

**Principle**: Model use must not increase risk to vulnerable populations.

**Key Concerns**:
- **Targeting risk**: Risk maps could be used to target pastoral communities for violence or surveillance
- **Stigmatization**: Labeling areas or communities as "high-risk" can lead to discrimination
- **Premature disclosure**: Sharing predictions could trigger preemptive actions that escalate tensions
- **Resource competition**: Humanitarian presence in predicted areas might alter local dynamics

**Safeguards**:
- Limit spatial precision in public-facing materials (regional level, not village-specific)
- Share detailed outputs only with vetted humanitarian and peacebuilding partners
- Never identify specific ethnic groups or communities in risk assessments
- Require signed data use agreements for detailed data access
- Regular review with conflict-sensitive programming experts

### 2. Community Agency and Participation

**Principle**: Affected communities should have voice in how they are represented and how interventions are designed.

**Current Gap**: This model is a top-down, remote sensing approach. It does not currently incorporate pastoral community knowledge or participation.

**Ethical Concerns**:
- **Extractive research**: Using data about communities without giving back
- **Paternalism**: External actors deciding what's best without consultation
- **Knowledge dismissal**: Ignoring indigenous knowledge about movement patterns and conflict drivers
- **Disempowerment**: Communities not informed about predictions that affect them

**Recommendations**:
1. **Co-design**: Engage pastoral representatives in model design and interpretation
   - What factors do *they* consider in movement decisions?
   - How do *they* assess resource availability and conflict risk?
   - What early warning indicators do *they* already use?

2. **Validation partnerships**: Work with community-based organizations to ground-truth predictions
   - Two-way information sharing
   - Respect for community knowledge systems

3. **Benefit sharing**: Ensure communities benefit from research
   - Provide early warning information in accessible formats (e.g., radio, SMS in local languages)
   - Support community-led early warning and response mechanisms
   - Capacity building for local organizations

4. **Consent and transparency**: 
   - Inform communities about how their areas are being monitored
   - Explain what satellite data shows and what it doesn't
   - Provide opt-out mechanisms where feasible

### 3. Data Protection and Security

**Principle**: Conflict-related data must be handled with utmost security to prevent misuse.

### Sensitive Data Categories

**High Sensitivity**:
- High-resolution risk maps (sub-5km)
- Temporal predictions (specific weeks)
- Combined with population/ethnic group data
- Movement pattern predictions
- Validation data (actual conflict locations)

**Medium Sensitivity**:
- Regional aggregated risk scores
- Environmental condition reports
- Historical pattern analysis

**Low Sensitivity**:
- Methodology documentation
- General environmental datasets (precipitation, vegetation)
- Academic publications

### Access Control Framework

| Data Type | Authorized Users | Access Requirements |
|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Detailed risk maps | UN agencies, international NGOs | Data use agreement, security clearance |
| Regional summaries | National government, local NGOs | Partnership agreement, training |
| Methodology | Academic researchers, public | None (open access) |
| Validation/conflict data | Research team only | Secure storage, need-to-know basis |

### Technical Safeguards

- **Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access logging**: Track who accesses what data and when
- **Anonymization**: Remove identifiable information from shared datasets
- **Secure sharing**: Use secure platforms (not email) for detailed outputs
- **Regular audits**: Review data access logs quarterly
- **Incident response**: Plan for data breach or misuse

---

### 4. Conflict Sensitivity

**Principle**: All interventions in conflict contexts can have unintended consequences; model use must be conflict-sensitive.

### Conflict-Sensitive Questions

Before sharing risk assessments, ask:

1. **Could this information exacerbate tensions?**
   - Example: Publicly identifying "high-risk" areas associated with specific groups

2. **Could humanitarian presence trigger negative dynamics?**
   - Example: Aid concentration attracting more people, straining local resources

3. **Could predictions become self-fulfilling?**
   - Example: Heightened security presence in predicted areas increasing tensions

4. **Are we reinforcing harmful narratives?**
   - Example: Framing pastoral mobility as inherently conflictual

5. **Who benefits and who is harmed?**
   - Example: Model helping some groups access resources while excluding others

### Conflict-Sensitive Practice

**Do**:
✅ Frame issues in terms of environmental conditions, not ethnic identities  
✅ Emphasize structural factors (water scarcity) not behavioral ones ("violent pastoralists")  
✅ Support preventive dialogue and resource-sharing agreements  
✅ Work through neutral, trusted intermediaries  
✅ Coordinate with peacebuilding actors, not just humanitarian ones  
✅ Support community-led conflict resolution mechanisms  

**Don't**:
❌ Provide information to armed actors or state security forces without human rights vetting  
❌ Publish maps that could be used for targeting  
❌ Use language that stigmatizes pastoral livelihoods  
❌ Ignore political and historical context of conflicts  
❌ Assume technology can solve fundamentally political problems

## Specific Ethical Challenges in South Sudan Context

### 1. Ethnic Dimensions of Pastoral Conflict

**Context**: Cattle-related conflicts in South Sudan often occur between Dinka and Nuer communities, with deep historical and political roots.

**Ethical Risks**:
- Reinforcing ethnic stereotypes
- Being perceived as taking sides
- Oversimplifying complex inter-ethnic dynamics

**Mitigation**:
- Never disaggregate data by ethnic group
- Emphasize shared vulnerability to environmental stress
- Highlight successful examples of inter-community cooperation
- Work with multi-ethnic peacebuilding organizations

---

### 2. Government Accountability vs. Community Protection

**Tension**: Sharing data with government can improve official response, but raises security concerns given human rights record.

**Considerations**:
- South Sudan government has been implicated in human rights abuses
- State security forces have been involved in cattle raiding
- Surveillance concerns are legitimate

**Approach**:
- Primary sharing with neutral UN and NGO partners
- Government briefings at aggregate level only (state-level, not village-level)
- Human rights due diligence for any government sharing
- Community consent required for any government coordination
- International humanitarian principles maintained

---

### 3. Research vs. Operational Use

**Distinction**: This is presented as a research/demonstration model, but could be used operationally.

**Ethical Implications**:
- **Research**: More flexibility, less immediate consequence
- **Operational**: Higher stakes, real-world impact on decisions

**Transition Considerations**:
If moving from research to operational use:
1. Conduct thorough impact assessment
2. Establish governance structure (oversight committee)
3. Develop standard operating procedures
4. Create accountability mechanisms
5. Obtain community consent
6. Secure long-term funding (sustainability)
7. Build local capacity (not external dependency)

## Responsible Communication

### Public Communication Guidelines

**When discussing the model publicly**:

✅ **DO emphasize**:
- Environmental factors (water, vegetation) not ethnic identities
- Complexity and limitations of predictions
- Model as a tool to support, not replace, local knowledge
- Humanitarian preparedness, not conflict prediction
- Partnership and participation

❌ **DO NOT**:
- Name specific villages or communities at risk
- Share maps with high spatial precision
- Frame pastoral mobility as problematic
- Claim to predict specific conflict events
- Ignore community voices and local context

### Media Engagement

If approached by media:
1. Consult with field partners before commenting
2. Provide regional context, not specific locations
3. Emphasize limitations and uncertainties
4. Redirect attention to root causes (structural issues)
5. Amplify community voices rather than replacing them

---

## Ethical Review and Oversight

### Recommended Governance Structure

For operational implementation, establish:

1. **Ethics Review Board**:
   - Includes conflict-sensitive programming experts
   - Community representatives
   - Human rights specialists
   - Independent researchers

2. **Advisory Group**:
   - Local NGO partners
   - UN agencies (OCHA, UNHCR, WFP)
   - Pastoral community leaders
   - Academic advisors

3. **Regular Reviews**:
   - Quarterly: Data access and use audits
   - Annually: Impact assessment and community feedback
   - As needed: Incident response and course correction

## Ethical Dilemmas and Discussion Points

### Dilemma 1: Accuracy vs. Safety Trade-off

**Question**: Is it ethical to reduce model accuracy (e.g., by lowering spatial resolution) for safety reasons?

**Perspectives**:
- **For**: Protection of vulnerable populations is paramount; imperfect information is better than dangerous information
- **Against**: Reduced accuracy could mean less effective humanitarian response, potentially harming those we aim to help

**Our Position**: Prioritize safety. Detailed outputs for vetted partners only; public outputs at reduced precision. Effectiveness can be maintained through secure partnerships.

---

### Dilemma 2: Prediction as Intervention

**Question**: Does the act of predicting and responding to risk change the outcome (observer effect)?

**Considerations**:
- Early warning → humanitarian presence → altered local dynamics
- Could prevent conflict (positive) or could create new tensions (negative)
- Potentially self-fulfilling or self-negating prophecy

**Our Position**: Acknowledge uncertainty. Monitor for unintended consequences. Prioritize community-led solutions that build resilience regardless of external presence.

---

### Dilemma 3: Open Science vs. Security

**Question**: Should methodology and code be fully open source given potential misuse?

**Perspectives**:
- **For open science**: Transparency, reproducibility, scientific progress, democratization of technology
- **For restriction**: Risk of misuse by harmful actors, responsibility to protect

**Our Position**: 
- Methodology and code: Open source (enables scrutiny, improvement, adaptation)
- Detailed data outputs: Restricted access with safeguards
- Balance transparency in methods with protection in application

## Conclusion: Ethical Imperative

This model exists because cattle-related conflicts cause immense human suffering in South Sudan. The ethical imperative to reduce harm justifies the research—**but only if**:

1. We prioritize affected communities' wellbeing above research goals
2. We acknowledge and mitigate risks of misuse
3. We work in partnership, not extraction
4. We remain humble about what technology can and cannot solve
5. We commit to continuous learning and course correction

**Technology is never neutral.** The question is not whether this model will have an impact beyond its intended purpose, but how we will anticipate, monitor, and respond to those impacts.

**Ultimately**: Models can inform but cannot replace the difficult work of building peace, which requires political will, inclusive governance, equitable resource management, and reconciliation—work that must be led by South Sudanese communities themselves.
